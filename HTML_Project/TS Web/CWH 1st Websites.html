                The primary reason technology is evolving so fast is because of accelerating change. Accelerating change
                is seen not just in the evolution of computers but in the improvement of all technology, including
                mobile phones and industrial equipment. </p>
            <p>
                Technology is evolving so fast because of a phenomenon known as Accelerating Change. Each technological
                improvement can create the next stronger generations of technology at a faster rate. As each generation
                of technology is better than the last it builds new technology faster. </p>

                <b> Why are advancements in technology growing so fast:- </b>
                Technology is the result of accumulated knowledge and application of
                skills, methods, and processes used in industrial production and scientific research. Technology is
                embedded in the operation of all machines and electronic devices, with or without detailed knowledge of
                their function, for the intended purpose of an organization. The technologies of society consist of what
                is known as systems. Systems operate by obtaining an input, altering this input through what is known as
                a process, and then producing an outcome that achieves the intended purpose of the system.
                We have more access to information than ever before, more base
                technologies to build from, more people in the world to develop new technologies and more opportunities
                for growth than ever before. Originally Answered: Why are advancements in technology growing
                exponentially faster?

            <p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange
                all kinds of data and information.
                The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to the
                application of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools and the discovery of how to
                control fire increased the sources of food that were available to human beings. The invention of the
                wheel led to the travelling technologies that helped humans to further increase the yield of food
                production, travel in less time, and exchange information and raw materials faster. Humanity then
                progressed to the development of the printing press, the telephone, the computer, and then the Internet.

                While technological advances have helped economies develop and create the rise of a leisure class, many
                technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and the depletion of natural
                resources from the Earth's environment. As a consequence, philosophical debates have arisen over the use
                of technology and whether technology improves or worsens the human condition. Neo-Luddism,
                anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology by
                stating that technology harms the environment and destroys human relationships. While this is the case,
                ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as
                beneficial to society and the human condition.

                While innovations have always influenced the values of a society and have raised new questions in the
                ethics of technology, the advancement of technology itself has also led to the pursuit of new solutions
                for the previously discussed concerns of technological advancement. For example, upcoming technology
                involves renewable resources being used in transportation, allowing humans to travel in space, for
                technology itself to become more affordable and reliable, and for increased automation.

            Science, engineering, and technology
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not
                always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through
                observation and experimentation.Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science,
                because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety.

                Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural
                phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science.
                The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering,
                mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

                Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity
                precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors
                by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to
                create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology.
                In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often
                considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.
